# toy-bot
Simple discord bot made to brush up on rust and play around with poise/serenity framework.
Also meant to be something I can put on github that isn't private or sensitive.

## TODO:
```
    - Implement clear chat command
    - Implement [color api](https://www.thecolorapi.com/) request functionality to retrive random color scheme and display in chat.
    - Possibly implement admin controls?
```
